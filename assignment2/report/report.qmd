# IR : Assignemnt 2  Pratik Ingle | 17188

Purple Robots p1 and p2 are positioned at location p1 = (-0.25,-0.5) and p2 = (1, -0.5) and goal at g1=(-1,0.5) and g2 = (0.85, 0.5) respectively. and path following is done using carrot chasing algorithm with parameters, (k=0.1, u_max = 0.4, v = 0.1, dt=0.01, delta= 0.01, sci=0.5).

Red robot R is using Bug2 algorithm path planing it has start position at (-1.75, -0.75) and goal at (1.9, 0.5) with abstacle avoidance in the left direction from p1, p2 robots using IR sensors. enviornment also has four circular obstacels with various radious located at (-0.5,-0.5), (0.85,0.5), (-0.85,-0.5) and (0.5,-0.5).
